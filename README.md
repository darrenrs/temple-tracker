# Temple Tracker

This full-stack web application allows temple recommend-holding members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to track visits to its worldwide temples.

I am working on this project in tandem with my two-year Church service mission. At the point of completion, I hope it will be a useful resource to help connect family and friends to these holy places of worship.

## Architecture

* Next.js with TypeScript simultaneously function as the frontend and backend
* PostgreSQL database
